# Interaction Lab Final Project Codes
 
This project is a game that uses Arduino and sensors to gain user input on the x and y axis on the user controlled icons. 


The Arduino is connected to two sharp infrared distance sensors and a switch mechanism. The zip file is a library that should be downloaded onto the Arduino IDE in order for the Arduino code to have access to the specific functions in the library. The zip files allows us to convert the information provided by the sharp ir sensor to useable values. 

The sharp infrared sensor part of the Arduino code is adapted from the following website:

Note: We also have the keyboard and mouse version in the zip file named final_draft_keyboard so feel free to try it out!
